## 🎨 Customization
- Change theme seed color in `MaterialApp.theme` to tweak the palette.
- Adjust slice colors via `_sliceColorFor` (HSV based around hue ~110 for sage).
- Edit fonts in `ThemeData.textTheme` (e.g., Baloo 2, Quicksand, Nunito).

## 🚀 Notes
- The Create screen requires at least 2 non-empty slices before starting.
- Drag handle at the end of each row reorders slices.
- The result banner shows the latest result and lets you copy it.
